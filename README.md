# UnityShellBuildTool

Build the Unity App With Shell Scripts.

We can create App with BuildPipeline.

Otherwise, We need customized static methods in Unity Editor directory for commandline args (-executeMethod).

- UNITY_PATH is your Unity location.
- PROJECT_PATH is your unity project location.
- DESTINATION_PATH is which you want to put your Unity App where.
